# Task - 1

# Project Overview:  

**A data analyst serves as the bridge between business requirements and actionable insights derived from data**

* Mae Mulligan, one of Accenture's Managing Directors and the client lead for Social Buzz, has thoroughly reviewed the project brief provided by the client.
* To ensure project success, Mae has assembled a diverse team of Accenture professionals with expertise tailored to the project needs.
* To set the tone for collaboration and alignment, Mae has scheduled a project kickoff meeting with the internal Accenture team for tomorrow morning.  
* About Client : [Social Buzz](https://github.com/mroyalreddy07/Accenture_Data_Analysis_Virtual_Intenship/blob/main/Data_Analytics%20Client%20Brief.pdf)

# Task from accenture

* The client has experienced rapid growth in recent years and lacks the internal resources to effectively manage the scale of their operations.  

**Three Key Objectives for Accenture:**  
1. Conduct an audit of the client's big data practices.  
2. Provide strategic recommendations for preparing for an IPO.  
3. Perform an in-depth analysis of trending and popular content.

# Task for Data Analyst:

**Objective:**  
Analyze sample datasets with visualizations to assess the popularity of various content categories.  

**Summary:**  
The client requested “An analysis of content categories highlighting the top 5 categories with the highest popularity.”  

# Task - 2

* In many cases, you won’t require all of these datasets to uncover the information you need.
* The first step is to apply this [data model](https://github.com/mroyalreddy07/Accenture_Data_Analysis_Virtual_Intenship/blob/main/Data%20model.pdf) to determine which datasets are essential for answering your     business question—specifically, identifying the top 5 categories with the highest popularity.
* After conducting the analysis, we identified the following datasets required to complete the analysis:

1. **Reaction Score** (used to quantify popularity)
2. **Content ID**
3. **Reaction Types**
4. **Content Type**
5. **Category**

# Data Cleaning:
# Let's dive into the data

So, let’s have a look at what data you have to work with. The client has sent through:

* 7 data sets - each data set contains different columns and values
* A data model - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.

 There is a lot of information here and it’s easy to get lost in the data. So, to make sure you are using the right data to answer the business questions you’ll follow these steps:

1. Requirements gathering
2. Data cleaning
3. Data modelling

# Example:

1. **Removing rows with missing values** to ensure the data is complete and accurate.
2. **Changing the data type of specific columns** to ensure they align with the necessary formats for analysis.
3. **Removing irrelevant columns** that do not contribute to answering the business question.  

As you evaluate each column, consider its relevance to the business question. If a column does not provide useful insight or directly contribute to understanding the top 5 categories with the largest popularity, it may be best to exclude it.

End result will be three cleaned data set :

* [Reaction Types](https://github.com/mroyalreddy07/Accenture_Data_Analysis_Virtual_Intenship/blob/main/ReactionTypes.csv)

* [Content](https://github.com/mroyalreddy07/Accenture_Data_Analysis_Virtual_Intenship/blob/main/Content.csv)

* [Reactions](https://github.com/mroyalreddy07/Accenture_Data_Analysis_Virtual_Intenship/blob/main/Reactions.csv)

# Data Modelling

**Create a final data set by merging your three tables together**

* We recommend using the Reaction table as your base table, then first join the relevant columns from your Content data set, and then the Reaction Types data set.

**Figure out the Top 5 performing categories**

* Add up the total scores for each category.

**The end result should be one spreadsheet which contains:**

1. A cleaned dataset
2. The top 5 categories

# Cleaned Data set:

  After data modeling and cleaning, the final result is the [Cleaned Dataset, ](https://github.com/mroyalreddy07/Accenture_Data_Analysis_Virtual_Intenship/blob/main/Cleaned%20Dataset.xlsx)

# Data Visualization Explained & Story telling:

  Data visualization is the process of representing data in a graphical format to help interpret, understand, and communicate insights more easily. It transforms raw data into visual elements like charts,       
  graphs, and maps, making complex patterns, trends, and relationships more accessible.

  **Key Points of Data Visualization:**

  1. Purpose:
     The main goal is to help the audience quickly understand trends, patterns, and insights from the data, enabling better decision-making.

  2. Types of Visualizations:
     Depending on the data and the analysis goals, different types of visualizations are used, such as:
  
  * Bar charts: To compare categories.
  * Pie charts: To show proportions of a whole.
  * PPT [Powerpoint Presentation](https://github.com/mroyalreddy07/Accenture_Data_Analysis_Virtual_Intenship/blob/main/Presentation%20DA_Task%203_final.pptx)
    The choice of visualization depends on the data type, the audience, and the message to be conveyed. For example, bar charts are ideal for comparing quantities across categories, while line graphs work best       for showing trends over time.

    Visualizations should be simple, clear, and focused on communicating key insights. Avoid cluttering visuals with too much information or unnecessary elements.

    In this project, data visualization will be used to highlight the top 5 content categories with the highest popularity, making it easier to identify trends and draw actionable insights for decision-making.

# Task - 4

# Presenting to the Client: PowerPoint Presentation on Analysis Insights.

  * To analyze content data and identify the top 5 most popular content categories.
  * Provide insights to inform content strategy and optimize audience engagement.

This version of the presentation delivers the insights from your analysis in a clear, concise manner, and focuses on actionable next steps and business value for the client.
